# @app/web

This is the React frontend of our application, built with
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Next.js uses the
[file-system as the main API](https://nextjs.org/docs#manual-setup) â”€ files
inside the [src/pages](./src/pages) folder automatically turn into routes of the
same name, for example the route `/login` is provided by
[src/pages/login.tsx](src/pages/login.tsx).
